Find Cynthia:
    emp_cd = Employee.query.filter_by(name='Cynthia Dueltgen').one()

What dept is she in?
    emp_cd.dept

What's her dept. phone number?
    emp_cd.dept.phone

All emps whose dept. we don't know:
    unknown_dept = db.session.query(Employee).filter(dept_code == None).all()

Tuples of name of everyone whose favorite color is orange:
    orange = db.session.query(Employee).filter(Employee.fav_color='orange').all()
    ^^ Syntax Error: keyword can't be an expression

    Had to separate into 2 lines:
    all_emps = db.session.query(Employee.name)
    orange = all_emps.filter(Employee.fav_color == 'orange').all()

All admin employees:
    all_emps = db.session.query(Employee.name)
    admin_emps = all_emps.filter(Employee.dept_code == 'admin').all()
